# Getting Started

Hello! This is Nick Gustafson's submission to LifeWay's coding challenge!
I hope you find all the Star Wars characters in the galaxy! 

## Available Scripts

*NOTE:* you must have the REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME environment variable in the .env file. Please see the email you received with this project to get that value. (It enables some cool features :)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
